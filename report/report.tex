\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The problem of deciding whether there exists a function preserving the edge relations of two graphs is known as the \textit{Graph Homomorphism Problem}. This problem in particular generalises some other more well known problems, such as the Graph Isomorphism Problem and the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem. The Subgraph Isomorphism Problem, also generalises well known problems such as the $k$-Clique Problem, and the Hamiltonian Path/Cycle problems.

The Graph Isomorphism Problem and the Subgraph Isomorphism Problems have been interesting problems that have been under investigation for as long as Cook and Levin's initial investigation into the class $\NP$. Graph Isomorphism is in the class $\NP \cap \coAM$ suggesting that Graph Isomorphism is not NP-complete unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses to the second level. On the other hand Subgraph Isomorphism (and by extension Graph Homomorphism) testing are canonical NP-complete problems, appearing in Karp's seminal paper\footnote{Karp also mentions Graph Isomorphism as an open question.}.

\section{Note Template Section Example}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:fake}
    This is a fake lemma
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
      x^{2} + 2^{x} &= 9 \\
      5 &= 3x + 2
    \end{align*}

    By union bound and constant probability.
\end{proof}

Here is an example theorem.
